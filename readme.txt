= Why use live video chat? =

Live chat applications for e-commerce and customer support use cases have been around for a couple of years, although video chat as a service channel has yet to take its rightful spot in the online services arena (says Mashable and we agree). Giving an opportunity for high value sales in industries like automotive or jewelry, live video chat can and will enhance online customer experiences with product presentation and service reliability.

= How is CustomerICare different than =

If you read up on Wikipedia, live chat in general is a term used for live support software to instantly provide online assistance to users of a website. While live chat is mainly used for text chats, our software goes a mile further and includes a multichannel chat for text, audio and video.

= Advantages of CustomerICare live chat =

The major advantage of live video chat, at least the chat software from CustomerICare, is that it comes bundled with popular live chat features for businesses, that include invitations which pop-up the chat window based on pre-defined rules, real-time website analytics (so it’s like Google Analytics, only without the limits and caveats you can click on people and engage customers via live chat or live video chat), a capability to customize the chat box and a few more. See the Pricing page for details of chat with us!

= Expensive, cheap or free chat? What’s best? =

Given the current market you can find reliable live chat solutions for every wallet size, although it can be a little disappointing if you don’t get a decent onboarding process, lack of customer care and not frequent issue resolution. We provide a free option for companies that want to test live chat. When happy they can move to a standard live chat in the cloud type of plan with monthly recurring rates or go for a full on enterprise level live chat implementation that sits within their own server farm.
